            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Google developing kill switch for AI - BBC News</h1><p>Scientists from Google's artificial intelligence division, DeepMind, and Oxford University are developing a "kill switch" for AI. In an academic paper, they outlined how future intelligent machines could be coded to prevent them from learning to over-ride human input. It is something that has worried experts, with Tesla founder Elon Musk particularly vocal in his concerns.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/5f11175616c7bf60c27ef49d7796b55f962cde78.gif"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>AI? More Like Aieeee!! For The First Time, A Robot Can Feel Pain</h1><p>Researchers are developing a system to teach robots how to feel pain.

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>We've Hit Peak Human and an Algorithm Wants Your Job. Now What?</h1><p>Are the humans of finance an endangered species? People are still the lubricant that oils the wheels of finance, toiling at innumerable tasks-executing and settling trades, writing analysis, monitoring risk. That's about to change. Squeezed by low interest rates, shrinking trading revenue, and nimbler technology-based competitors, banks are racing to remake themselves as digital companies to cut costs and better serve clients.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/820428140bd86942410beece454584f0b6099333.jpg"></article>]]></description>

Five years later, voice-enacted A.I. is booming: 65% of smartphone owners use voice assistants, according to Mary Meeker's annual report on the state of the Internet. That usage has more than doubled in the last three years.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/c90add5a8e2e5c91929c6fb6d16f39510dc71dfa.png"></article>]]></description>
