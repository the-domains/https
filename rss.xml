            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Voice controlled A.I. is about to go mainstream-here's why</h1><p>When Siri arrived in 2011, it was easy to poke fun at our first voice-controlled robo-assistant. Five years later, voice-enacted A.I. is booming: 65% of smartphone owners use voice assistants, according to Mary Meeker's annual report on the state of the Internet. That usage has more than doubled in the last three years.</p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/fast-company/image/upload/v1464807249/fastconews/wxsuoasl1hcoojixp1xf.png"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>A lethal AI robot will police the Great Barrier Reef for starfish</h1><p>Climate change, pollution, and unsustainable fishing practices have threatened the world's largest coral structure but there's some hope for Australia's Great Barrier Reef. An intelligent robot is ready to protect it. Researchers have developed a robot that seeks out and kills one of the leading cause of coral loss-the crown-of-thorns starfish (COTS).</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/43f74b665b3e913c0ad62931be37f2f2de52d64d.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>What Google's DeepMind victory really means</h1><p>It's 1997. The Backstreet Boys debut in the U.S. with one of the most successful albums of all time. Microsoft is the world's most valuable company, with a $261 billion market cap. And an IBM computer named Deep Blue defeats Garry Kasparov, reigning world chess champion and, at the time, the highest-ranked chess player to have ever lived.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/174035535be27f7ecb7f88442320a9c2f757be29.jpg"></article>]]></description>
