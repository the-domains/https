            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Artificial Intelligence Designs Ultimate Road Trip</h1><p>Loyal readers will recall that last spring we conspired with artificial intelligence expert Randal Olsen to develop the ultimate U.S. road trip. The map Olson came up with -- he did all the work, really -- optimized the best way to drive by car to 50 major U.S.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/91b7a636be7cf6aec1eb9d1ae1eb223b3419e1a1.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>AI? More Like Aieeee!! For The First Time, A Robot Can Feel Pain</h1><p>Researchers are developing a system to teach robots how to feel pain. That might seem counterintuitive, as IEEE Spectrum points out. After all, "One of the most useful things about robots is that they don't feel pain."</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/79920ee16bcde2ae741c75f2c75d08581ed23eb1.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>We've Hit Peak Human and an Algorithm Wants Your Job. Now What?</h1><p>Are the humans of finance an endangered species? People are still the lubricant that oils the wheels of finance, toiling at innumerable tasks-executing and settling trades, writing analysis, monitoring risk. That's about to change. Squeezed by low interest rates, shrinking trading revenue, and nimbler technology-based competitors, banks are racing to remake themselves as digital companies to cut costs and better serve clients.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/820428140bd86942410beece454584f0b6099333.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Voice controlled A.I. is about to go mainstream-here's why</h1><p>When Siri arrived in 2011, it was easy to poke fun at our first voice-controlled robo-assistant. Five years later, voice-enacted A.I. is booming: 65% of smartphone owners use voice assistants, according to Mary Meeker's annual report on the state of the Internet. That usage has more than doubled in the last three years.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/c90add5a8e2e5c91929c6fb6d16f39510dc71dfa.png"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>A lethal AI robot will police the Great Barrier Reef for starfish</h1><p>Climate change, pollution, and unsustainable fishing practices have threatened the world's largest coral structure but there's some hope for Australia's Great Barrier Reef. An intelligent robot is ready to protect it. Researchers have developed a robot that seeks out and kills one of the leading cause of coral loss-the crown-of-thorns starfish (COTS).</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/43f74b665b3e913c0ad62931be37f2f2de52d64d.jpg"></article>]]></description>
