      Idea in Brief The Threat Automation has traditionally displaced workers,
      forcing them onto higher ground that machines have not yet claimed. Today,

      intelligence." Ray is also amazing at predicting a lot more beyond just

  It's 1997. The Backstreet Boys debut in the U.S. with one of the most
  successful albums of all time. Microsoft is the world's most valuable company,
  with a $261 billion market cap. And an IBM computer named Deep Blue defeats
  Garry Kasparov, reigning world chess champion and, at the time, the
  highest-ranked chess player to have ever lived.
